- JDK 11 or later
- Scala 3
- sbt (Scala Build Tool)
- JDBC Compatible DB (MySQL database by default)

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jorgegfx/RobotTrader.git
   cd RobotTrader
2. Set up the MySQL database:
Create a database and update the src/main/resources/application.conf file with your database configuration.
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE trading;
    CREATE USER 'trading_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON trading.* TO 'trading_user'@'localhost';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
3. Run the application:
    ```sh
    sbt run
## Configuration
The application uses HOCON configuration format. Update the src/main/resources/application.conf file with your database and application settings.
```hocon
{
  dataBaseConfig = {
    url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/robot_trading"
    user = "trading"
    password = "trading"
    driver = "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"
  }
  strategyConfigurations = {
    macd = {
        snapshotInterval = "OneMinute"
    }
    openGap = {
        signalCount = 5
    }
  }
}
```
## Trading Strategies
### Gap Strategy
The Gap trading strategy identifies gaps between the closing price of the previous day and the opening price of the current day. It executes trades based on the size of the gap.

### MACD Strategy
The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) strategy uses the difference between short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) to generate buy and sell signals. It includes a signal line to identify trading signals.

## Architecture
The Trading App creates orders from the execution service that relies on the input and the signals in order to generate the orders
